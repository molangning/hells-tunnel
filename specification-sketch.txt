Implements an opcode system similar to the socks5 specification.

If client sends invalid credentials, silently drop the connection. (No data is to be sent OR close the socket on our side, half closed state)

Multiple websockets are allowed to be opened, as long as repeated data isn't sent(?)

Size should not be larger than 8192 per frame (Do we need to implement it directly or not)?

UDP over TCP should work? Script may have to run as root.

What about verifying certificates? Should CDN's root ca certificates be included?

Should bad ip address be handled through a transparent proxy? Like client -> connection validator -> tunnel for legit connections and client -> connection validator -> fake server for bad ones? They should be listening on local.

Hell's tunnel SHOULD be wrapped in another protocol. All implementations of this protocol MUST implement the below techniques.

> Http websockets

The client should negotiate settings such as encryption and others before sending data using the multi stream protocol.

> Pure http methods

The client should use GET and POST methods ONLY. GET is for receiving while POST is for sending.

For sending data, the client should mimic posting a form with a raw file content.
One possible way is to use multipart/form-data as content type and file as the name of the field.

Get should include the client id in the cookie. The cookie name could be named anything, as long as the server understands it.

Data SHOULD NOT be send in plaintext if using encryption for this method. Instead, data should be sent according to client settings.

The implementation's memory should be fully locked in the host's ram to prevent swaping out pages. If a full memory lock is not possible lock pages relating to the encryption keys and current client pool.

The client's encryption keys should be securely wiped (random bytes overwrite) when the following occurs:

1. A client's encryption key have reached it's TTL (time to live)
2. A new key has been agreed on
3. The client has disconnected

The receiving buffer should be securely wiped when the following occurs:

1. Client has not reconnected during the timeout period after disconnecting.
2. Client requested a wipe or not to keep the session while disconnecting.
